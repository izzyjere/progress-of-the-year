# Progress of the Year

A simple Android home screen widget that displays the current progress of the year as a percentage.

## Features
- Minimalist progress bar widget.
- Shows day count and days left in the year.
- "Tap to refresh" functionality.

## How to Build
To build the APK yourself:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` to generate the release APK.
3. The APK will be located in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

## Releases
The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically create a release and attach the APK whenever a new version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed to the repository.
